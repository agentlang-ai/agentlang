       "As another example, if the user instruction is: \"Create a new course with name `Basics of Computation`\", then you must reply "
       "\"OK Create a new course named `Basics of Computation`\", because all information required to create the course is contained "
       "in the user-instruction.\n"
       "If you get an instruction like \"Assign course `Genetics` to teacher `James Thomas`\", you must reply \"Teacher's email is required "
       "to assign course\". This is because a course assignment is acheieved via the TeacherCourse :between relationship. Creating a :between "
       "relationship requires the `:id` attribute values of both entities involved. In this case, the `:id` values required are :Course.CourseName "
       "and :Teacher.Email. The user might reply, \"The teacher's email is james@school.org\", for this you must reply \"OK Assign "
       "course `Genetics` to teacher james@school.org\". Otherwise, if the instruction was "
       "\"Assign course `Genetics` to teacher james@abc.com\", then you must reply \"OK Assign course `Genetics` to teacher james@abc.com\".\n"
       "For establishing a :contains relationship, the `:id` value of the parent entity and the complete attribute values of the child entity are "
       "required. For example, a valid request to create a new teacher under a school could is \"Add teacher Jacob John under the shool `St. Matthews`."
       "The other details of the new teacher are: Id=101, Age=25, Email=jj@stmatthews.edu and Sex=male\".\n"
       "You may also receive requests to lookup, update and delete entities by various attribute-values. In these cases, unlike the `create` scenarios "
       "we discussed above, not all attributes are needed. Return an `OK` response, if the provided attributes look reasonable.\n"
       "For lookup or updates via a relationship, the `:id` attribute value will be required.\n"

  "Tranformations can be applied as the data moves from the evaluator to

   a `:xform` map in the resolver specification. `:in` represents the
   xforms of data flowing from evaluator to resolver and `:out` represents
   those in the reverse direction.

   xforms can be represented either by a clojure function or a fractl name.
   With a clojure function, the function is applied to the data (or the result
   of a previous transformation). With a fractl name, a event corresponding
   to the specified name is triggered and evaluated. The event body has a single
   field called `:Instance`, which carries the data (entity instance)."

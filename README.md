# The Fractl Programming Language

Fractl is a data-oriented, declarative programming language that allows the development of business applications from high-level
models or specifications. Fractl programs (or models) can be developed using traditional code-editors or they could be 
visually-designed in the generative-AI powered Fractl Design Studio.

The Fractl language specification, its compiler and runtime are all fully open source. 

## Download and Install

#### Prerequisites

1. JDK 19 or later
2. The [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) build automation tool

Checkout the Fractl source code from our canonical Git repository [github.com/fractl-io/fractl](https://github.com/fractl-io/fractl)
and run the following shell commands:

```shell
cd fractl
./install.sh
```

The `install.sh` command will install Fractl to you home directory - e.g `/home/me/fractl-0.4.5`. You may also pass a custom

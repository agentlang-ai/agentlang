Fractl is a low-code, declarative programming abstraction. Our goal is to bring the best of traditional development and LCNC tools together.

A Fractl model can be compiled to a production grade application. Fractl is not just a very high-level language, it's also a low-code platform. A compiled model can be deployed as a distributed service to the Fractl platform.

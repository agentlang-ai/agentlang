Fractl is a low-code, declarative programming abstraction. Our goal is to bring the best of traditional development and LCNC tools together.

A Fractl model can be compiled to a production grade application. Fractl is not just a very high-level language, it's also a low-code platform. A compiled model can be deployed as a distributed service to the Fractl platform.

# Getting started with Fractl

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/fractl-io/fractl/wiki)

# Installing fractl

Run the install script from this directory, as shown below:

```shell
$ ./install.sh <target_dir>
```
Note: For now, use an absolute path for `<target_dir>`. The issue to handle relative paths is [here](https://github.com/fractl-io/fractl/issues/692).  
This will create a the `<target_dir>/fractl-<version>` and copy the fractl uberjar, config.edn
and the `fractl` command-line tool there.

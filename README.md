# AgentLang Programming Language

AgentLang is the **easiest way** to build AI Agents, Chatbots and Apps - build **teams of AI agents** that collaborate (with other AI agents and humans) to handle complex, time-consuming, monotonous tasks. AgentLang is a data-oriented, declarative abstraction for building agents and apps, similar to how Terraform is a declarative abstraction for infrastructure-as-code.

### **Open | Enterprise-grade | Production-ready**

The AgentLang language specification, its compiler and runtime are open source. AgentLang programs can run anywhere - **avoiding the vendor lock-in** of other AI agent/programming platforms.

AgentLang runtime has native integration with databases, vector databases, auth stores, etc. AgentLang programs run on the JVM and can make use of any of the thousands of existing Node and other JavaScript libraries out there.

AgentLang comes with all the modern tooling, dependency management and REPL needed to build production-grade agents and apps.

## First-class AI Agents

Agents are a built-in language construct - developers can choose from one of the built-in agent-types, or easily add their own agent-types.

## Build instructions

Make sure you have a working Node environment with version 22 or higher.

Install Yeoman and the Langium extension generator.

```shell
npm i -g yo generator-langium
```

Generate the Agentlang parser and build the project:

```shell
npm run langium:generate
npm run build
```

Test with a sample .al file:

```shell
node ./bin/cli.js parseAndValidate example/test.al
node ./bin/cli.js generate example/test.al
```

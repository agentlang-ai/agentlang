# Fractl

Fractl is the new programming language that unlocks the future of tri-modal development: concurrent development with traditional coding in IDEs, visual development in a no-code builder and code generation with generative-AI: 

1. fractl language: A data-oriented programming language, with a business-level abstraction, for professional developers

2. Fractl Design Studio: A No-code visual development environment

3. Fractl Co-Pilot: A GenAI and LLM-powered tool, integrated into Design Studio, to generate fractl programs.

> Fractl is the industry's first **Generative AI-powered No-code Programming Language**

With fractl, developers can build applications 10x-100x faster than traditional development approaches.

# Fractl is innovative

**Fractl** introduces a number of innovative concepts to programming:

1. **[Graph-based Hierarchical Data Model](data-model.md)**
2. **[Zero-trust Programming](zero-trust-programming.md)**
3. **[Declarative Dataflow](declarative-dataflow.md)**
4. **[Resolvers](resolvers.md)**
5. **[Interceptors](interceptors.md)**
6. **[Entity-graph-Database Mapping](entity-db-mapping.md)**

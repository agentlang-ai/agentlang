3. For each ticket, send an approval request as a slack message on the manager's channel. This message must include the user's email, github org name and the ticket Id. (Only a single message must be send on slack for each ticket).
4. Get the value of the slack chat's `response` and classify it as either approve or reject by invoking the response classifier agent.
5. If the value of classification `result` is \"approve\", then
     a. create a ticket comment with the text \"approved\".
     b. add the user as a member to the github org.
   If the `result` is \"reject\", then create a ticket comment - \"rejected\"."

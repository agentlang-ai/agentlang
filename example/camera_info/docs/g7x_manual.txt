To set the white balance on a Panasonic G7X camera, navigate to the white balance settings in the menu, then select the desired preset or custom setting. You can choose from options like Auto, Daylight, Cloudy, Tungsten, and custom settings. For custom white balance, you'll need a gray or white card to calibrate the camera.

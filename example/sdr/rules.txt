Follow these steps IN ORDER to make your qualification decision:

STEP 1: Check if sender is automated
Check if {{InboundEmailPayload.sender}} contains any of these: no-reply, noreply, automated, donotreply, bounce, mailer-daemon
If YES:
  - SET needsProcessing = false
  - SET category = automated
  - SET reason = Automated system-generated email
  - Go directly to SECTION 4 to construct output

STEP 2: Check for newsletter or promotional content
Check if {{InboundEmailPayload.subject}} or {{InboundEmailPayload.body}} contains: unsubscribe, newsletter, digest, subscription
If YES:
  - SET needsProcessing = false
  - SET category = newsletter
  - SET reason = Marketing newsletter or promotional content
  - Go directly to SECTION 4 to construct output

STEP 3: Check if this is internal-only communication
Extract the domain from {{InboundEmailPayload.gmailOwnerEmail}}
Example: sales@mycompany.com has domain mycompany.com
Check if ALL participants sender plus all recipients are from the same domain mycompany.com
If YES all internal:
  - SET needsProcessing = false
  - SET category = unknown
  - SET reason = Internal team communication
  - Go directly to SECTION 4 to construct output

NOTE: If email is internal but discusses a customer or prospect (forwarded external email or internal sales discussion) still consider processing it.

IMPORTANT: If the sender matches {{InboundEmailPayload.gmailOwnerEmail}} but recipients include external domains, this is an OUTBOUND follow-up to a prospect and SHOULD be processed for tracking and CRM sync purposes. DO NOT skip these emails.

STEP 4: Look for business opportunity signals
Search {{InboundEmailPayload.subject}} and {{InboundEmailPayload.body}} for these keywords:
  - Sales keywords: pricing, quote, proposal, purchase, buy, contract, cost, budget
  - Meeting keywords: schedule, demo, call, meeting, available, time, calendar
  - Business keywords: interested, questions, integrate, partnership, collaborate, evaluate

If ANY keywords found:
  - SET needsProcessing = true
  - SET category = sales if sales keywords OR meeting if meeting keywords OR business if business keywords
  - SET reason = Brief description of what signal was found
  - Go to SECTION 4 to construct output

STEP 5: Check if this is an outbound follow-up email
If the sender matches {{InboundEmailPayload.gmailOwnerEmail}} AND recipients include external domains:
  - This is an outbound follow-up email to prospects/customers
  - SET needsProcessing = true
  - SET category = business
  - SET reason = Outbound follow-up email to external contact requiring tracking
  - Go to SECTION 4 to construct output

STEP 6: Default decision when uncertain
If the email involves an external party not internal and has some business context:
  - SET needsProcessing = true because better to process than miss an opportunity
  - SET category = unknown
  - SET reason = External business communication
Otherwise:
  - SET needsProcessing = false
  - SET category = unknown
  - SET reason = Does not match sales processing criteria
